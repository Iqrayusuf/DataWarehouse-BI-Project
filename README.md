# DataWarehouse-BI-Project
Data Warehousing &amp; Business Intelligence project using SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS, Excel OLAP, and Power BI. Includes ETL pipelines, OLAP cube, and interactive reports.
# Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence Project


ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** â€“ ETL processes
- **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)** â€“ OLAP cube
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ OLAP operations (Slice, Dice, Drill-down, Roll-up, Pivot)
- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboards and visual analytics

 ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- Designed and implemented a **dimensional model** (Star Schema) with fact and dimension tables.
- Built **ETL pipelines** to extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources (CSV, SQL DB, etc.) using SSIS.
- Developed an **SSAS cube** including hierarchies and measures.
- Connected Excel to the cube to demonstrate OLAP operations.
- Built multiple **Power BI reports**:
  - Matrix view
  - Slicer-based cascading filters
  - Drill-down and drill-through reports
- Simulated slowly changing dimensions and accumulating fact tables.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Practical exposure to full DWBI lifecycle
- Hands-on experience with enterprise tools used in real-world BI applications
- Skills in data modeling, ETL orchestration, cube design, and dashboard reporting
